This program is used to calculate the beam of radar that can be blocked by the topography (Hills, mountains..)

Using the location and attribute (Elevation, nrays, nbins, range..) of radar as input

The result can be plot to the map in single mode or composite mode (plot multi radar) by matplotlib

Main libralies: - Wradlib, Pyqt5, Matplotlib
